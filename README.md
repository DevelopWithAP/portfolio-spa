# My Developer Portfolio 
My Developer portfolio built as an SPA using `React`, `TypeScript`, styled with `Tailwind CSS` and using `vite` as a front-end tooling.
In its previous rendition, my portfolio was built with `Django` and plain `HTML`, and it was very simple. 
My favourite feature in this app is the ability to toggle between dark and light mode.
